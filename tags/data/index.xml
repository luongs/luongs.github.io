      <description>I have recently stumbled on video lectures for python&amp;rsquo;s Jupyter library for data visualization on A Cloud Guru and decided to give it a try. I often wondered how the content in r/dataisbeautiful had been created, but also wanted to create and post interesting and meaningful insights from data.
The course pointed me towards the pandas, matplotlib and seaborn library on python. Creating beautiful graphs was surprisingly easy on python. The course only scratched the surface when it came to the possibilities of those libraries, but did mention kaggle as a resource.</description>
